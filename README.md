## About The Project

#### This was a refactor of my initial portfolio created at the beginning of my coding journey two months ago! This project required a revised portfolio featuring my first group project and two individual projects (with links to each respective repo and deployed page). It was also to provide a downloadable résumé and links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles. The portfolio was to render responsively across a variety of devices with a clean and polished user interface. 

## Demo

##### This video clip demonstrates the portfolio's rendering and functionality on a mobile device. <br>
